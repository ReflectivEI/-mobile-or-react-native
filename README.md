# ReflectivEI Mobile App

This repository contains a simple React Native prototype for **ReflectivEI**, an emotional intelligence (EI) platform for teens and educators. The app mirrors the high‑level flow and psychological triggers of the Reflectiv landing page, providing a hands‑on demonstration of the core features:

* **Home** – Introduces the app’s purpose and offers navigation to each feature.
* **EI Assessment** – Describes the validated EI assessments used (e.g. Six Seconds’ SEI, MSCEIT) and links to a forthcoming assessment module.
* **Mood Tracker** – Allows users to select their current mood with emoji buttons and save the selection. A placeholder illustration hints at future mood charting.
* **Journal** – Presents a daily reflection prompt and text area for journaling, helping users develop self‑awareness and emotional regulation.
* **Dashboard** – Displays sample statistics (EI score, journal count, streak, average mood) to illustrate how progress could be visualised.

## Why Reflective AI matters

ReflectiveEI is designed around **reflective AI**, a principle that moves beyond reactive systems to self‑improvement. Neil Sahota explains that AI systems need to reflect on their past actions, identify mistakes, and adjust to perform better—bridging simple automation and adaptive learning【663669075400533†L44-L74】. While the mobile app presented here is a front‑end prototype for people, its goal is to encourage **human reflection**—users review their emotions and behaviours, learn from them, and refine future responses. This mirrors the reflection process in agentic AI but empowers humans to lead their own growth.
